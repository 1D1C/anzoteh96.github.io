    <p title="About me">
        Hello there! I am Anzo Zhao Yang Teh,
        a Malaysian student currently pursuing a Mathematics degree at the University of Waterloo.
    </p>
        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>University of Waterloo, Bachelor of Mathematics (Class of 2021).</li>
            <li>Sunway College, G.C.E. A-Levels (Class of 2015).</li>
            <li>Chung Ling (National Type) High School Butterworth, Malaysian Certificate of Education (Class of 2013).</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Mathematical Background</h2>
    <p>
        My exposure into Mathematical Olympiad started in 2007 when I took part in the Asian-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools. 
        However, it wasn't until 2010 when I started to delve deep into mathematical problem solving, and to learn writing mathematical proofs. 
        That was the time I first join the International Mathematical Olympiad training camps, and to-date I have won the following awards:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Mathematical Olympiad</a>: 1 Gold (2014), 2 Silver (2012, 2013), 1 Honourable Mention (2011).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.ommenlinea.org/apmo/">Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiad</a>: 3 Silver (2012, 2014, 2015), 2 Bronze (2011, 2013).
            </li>
            <li>
                Raffles Invitational Mathematical Olympiad: Silver medal (2012).
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.amt.edu.au/mathematics/amc/">Australian Mathematics Competition</a>: 1 Medal (2012), 6 Prizes (2009-2013, 2015).
            </li>
            <li>
                2015 <a href="http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/euclid.html">Euclid Contest</a>: Ranked 15/14396 worldwide (International Student Honour Roll, Group 2) with a score of 90%. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        At undergraduate level, I won an Honourable Mention in the 2016 <a href="http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/putnam-competition-individual-and-team-winners">William Lowell Putnam Competition</a> with a score of 72/120, 
        placing me at rank 32/4164 overall and second among students in the University of Waterloo. 
        I was also one of the members in the three-person Waterloo Putnam team that finished in 6th place out of 568 participating universities.
    </p>
    <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Among high-school Mathematical Olympiad topics, Number Theory fascinates me the most. 
        It is very intriguing to think how ideas as simple as "divisibility of numbers" and "remainders" can be transformed into various problems in the Mathematical Olympiad. 
        (In fact, three of the problems I proposed to the Junior Olympiad of Mathematics are Number Theory). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Geometry comes next, and was one of my strongest area in Mathematical Olympiad (thanks to my trigonometric tricks).
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    Some of the cool things I have done are: 
    <ul>
        <li>Initiating a Junior Olympiad in January 2013. </li>
        <li>Composing a graduation song for my Graduating Class of 2013 in Chung Ling High School.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-Mathematical Interests</h2>
    Some other interests of mine include:
    <ul>
        <li>Competitive coding</li>
        <li>Piano playing</li>
        <li>Blogging</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
    </ul>
