        The idea of hosting a Junior Olympiad of Mathematics for the junior students in the IMO camp ignited my thoughts of creating problems for the junior students. 
        The first few problems were proposed after IMO 2012, where I got inspiration from problems 4 and 5 in the IMO.
    </p>

    <p>Below are the 10 problems I proposed for the first three editions of JOM. Have fun solving!</p>
    
    <p>
    <b>JOM 2015, A6. </b>
        Let $(a_{n})_{n\ge 0}$ and $(b_{n})_{n\ge 0}$ be two sequences with arbitrary real values $a_0, a_1, b_0, b_1$. For $n\ge 1$, let $a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}$ be defined in this way:
        $$a_{n+1}=\dfrac{b_{n-1}+b_{n}}{2}, b_{n+1}=\dfrac{a_{n-1}+a_{n}}{2}$$
        Prove that for any constant $c>0$ there exists a positive integer $N$ s.t. for all $n>N$, $|a_{n}-b_{n}|< c$.
    </p>
    <button class="button" onclick="hideandshow(A6, A6button)" id="A6button">Show solution</button>
    <p id="A6" style="border: 1px solid black; display: none;">
        Let $(c_n)_{n\ge 0}$ be a sequence with $c_n=a_n-b_n$, then 
        $c_{n+2}=-\frac{c_n+c_{n+1}}{2}$. In the same way
        we obtain $c_{n+3} = -\frac{c_{n+2}+c_{n+1}}{4}=\frac{c_n-c_{n+1}}{4}$.
        Now, by triangle inequality $|c_{n+2}|\le \frac 12 (|c_n|+|c_{n+1}|)$
        and $|c_{n+3}|\le\frac 14 (|c_{n+1}+|c_n|). $
        Hence, $|c_{n+2}|+|c_{n+3}|\le \frac 34 (|c_n|+|c_{n+1}|)$. 
        Repeating the step gives $|c_{2n}|+|c_{2n+1}|\le \left(\frac 34\right)^n (|c_0|+|c_1|)$. 
        We can take $N=2\log _{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{c}{|c_0|+|c_1|}\right)+2$
        so that for all $n\ge N$, 
        $|c_n|$
        $\le |c_n|+|c_{n+1}|$
        $\le \left(\frac 34\right)^{\frac 12 n} (|c_0|+|c_1|)$
        $< \left(\frac 34\right)^{\log _{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{c}{|c_0|+|c_1|}\right)} (|c_0|+|c_1|)$
        $=c$, 
        as desired.

    <p><b>JOM 2014, C6. </b>Let $n$ be a positive integer. 
    At the beginning, two frogs, $A$ and $B$ are at point 0 of a number line. 
    At each second, they jump to the right and stop after arriving at $n$, following the constraints below:
    <br />
    (i) Each of them must jump either 1 or 2 step(s) every second.
    <br />
    (ii) Both of them must arrive at $n$ at the same time.
    <br />
    (iii) Frog $A$ must never be behind $B$ during the jump.
    <br />
    Let $f(n)$ be the number of arrangements of the sequence of jumps for the two frogs. Prove that 
    $f(n)\ge 2^{n-1}$.</p>
    <button class="button" onclick="hideandshow(C6, C6button)" id="C6button">Show solution</button>
    <div id="C6" style="border: 1px solid black; display: none;">
        <p>
            Let $g(n)$ be the number of arrangements of the sequence of jumps that follows the constraint of $f(n)$ except frog $A$ arrives at $n+1$ and $B$ arrives at $n$ simultaneously.
            The strategy is to induct on both $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ to prove that $f(n), g(n)\ge 2^{n-1}$.
            Denote $(a_1+a_2+\cdots +a_k, b_1+b_2+\cdots +b_k)$ to be the sequence of jumps by frogs $A$ and $B$ where $a_i, b_i\in\{1, 2\}$. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Base case. </i> $f(1)=1$ because $(1,1)$ is the only sequene. $f(2)=2$ because we have $(2,2), (1+1, 1+1)$. 
            $g(1)=1$ as we have $(2,1)$ while $g(2)=2$ as we have $(2+1, 1+1)$ and $(1+2, 1+1)$.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Inductive step. </i> 
            Now assume that there is an $n\ge 2$ such that $f(k), g(k)\ge 2^{k-1}$ for all $k=1,2,\cdots ,n$. 
            In counting $f(n+1)$, we know that the second last position for $A$ and $B$ can be 
            $(n,n)$, $(n-1, n-1)$ or $(n, n-1)$. This means 
            $f(n+1)=f(n)+f(n-1)+g(n-1)\ge 2^{n-1}+2^{n-2}+2^{n-2}=2^n.$
            In counting $g(n+1)$, the last step can be 
            $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2)$ whereby the second last position is 
            $(n+1, n)$, $(n,n)$, $(n+1, n-1)$, $(n, n-1)$.
            Thus $g(n+1)\ge g(n)+f(n)+g(n-1)\ge 2^{n-1}+2^{n-1}+2^{n-2}\ge 2^n$. Q.E.D.

    <p><b>JOM 2014, Problem 5 (G5).</b>
    Given $\triangle ABC$ with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and circumcentre $O$. 
    Let $X$ to be a point on $\Gamma$. 
    Let $XC_1$, $XB_1$ to be feet of perpendiculars from $X$ to lines $AB$ and $AC$. 
    Let $\omega_C$ to be circle with centre the midpoint of $AB$ and passing through $C_1$ . 
    Define $\omega_B$ similarly.
    <br />
    Prove that $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ has a common point on $XO$.</p>

        <p>
            Let $P$ be the projection from $A$ to $XO$ and we claim that $P$ lies on $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$. 
            Let the midpoint of $AC$ be $M_B$. 
            Since $\angle XB_1A=XPA=90^{\circ}$, we have $X, B_1, P, A$ concyclic and 
            $\angle (PB_1, B_1A)=\angle (PX, XA)$ and
            $\angle (B_1P, PX)=\angle (B_1A, AX)$. 
            Also, since $O, M_B, A, P$ are concyclic (becuse $\angle OM_BA=\angle OPA=90^{\circ}$), 
            we have $\angle (OP, PM_B)=\angle (OA, AM_B)$. 
            So $\angle (PB_1, B_1A)=\angle (PB_1, B_1M_B)$
            $=\angle (PX, XA)$
            $=\angle (OX, XA)$
            $=\angle (XA, AO)$
            $=\angle (XA, AB_1)+\angle (AB_1, AO)$
            $=\angle (XP, PB_1)+\angle (AM_B, AO)$
            $=\angle (OP, PB_1)+\angle (PM_B, PO)$
            $=\angle (PM_B, PB_1)$. 
            This means $M_BB_1=M_BP$ and $P$ lies on $\omega_B$. 
            Likewise, it lies on $\omega_C$.

            <br />
            (i) $a - b = c$.
            <br />
            (ii) $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a, c) = \gcd(b, c) = 1$.

    <div id="N11" style="border: 1px solid black; display: none;">
        <p>
            <b>Solution 1. </b>
            We may assume that $c>0$ since if $a-b=c$ then $b-a=-c$. 
            Let $p, q$ be distinct primes not divisible by $c$. 
            Consider the set $P=\{ap^2 | a\in\mathbb{N}\}$. 
            Since $p^2\perp q^2$, 
            $P$ contains the complete residues mod $q^2$, 
            and there exist infinitely many $a$ such that $ap^2\equiv c\pmod{q^2}$. 
            So there exists $a, b$ with $ap^2-bq^2=c$, and $b$ positive for $a$ sufficiently large. 
            Clearly, $ap^2$ and $bq^2$ are composite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that $a$ may not be relatively prime to $c$. 
            However, for any $x\in\mathbb{N}$ we have 
            $(a+xq^2)p^2-(b+xp^2)q^2=c$. 
            Moreover, $c, p, q$ are pairwise relatively prime. 
            Thus by Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many $x$ such that 
            $a+xq^2$ and $c$ are relatively prime. 
            The rest of the conclusion follows from that 
            $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a, c) = \gcd(b, c)$. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Solution 2. </b>
            W.L.O.G. let $c>0$. Let $a=(2c+1)!+2c+1$ and $b=(2c+1)!+c+1$. 
            $\gcd (a,c)=\gcd (2c+1, c)=1$ since $c|(2c+1)!$. 
            Moreover, $2c+1|(2c+1)!+2c+1$ and $c+1|(2c+1)!+c+1$ and both $2c+1, c+1>1$.

            <b>JOM 2013, A5.</b>
            Find all polynomials $P\in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that
            $P(x)+P(y)+P(z)=0\Rightarrow x+y+z=0$.

        <p id="A5" style="border: 1px solid black; display: none;">
            <b>Answer. </b> All $P\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ such that $P(x) = ax$ or $P(x) = ax^{2n}Q(x)$ for some $a\neq 0$, $n\ge 0$, and $Q(x)$
            with no real root.<br />
            <b> Solution 1</b> (Justin Lim). If $P(x) = 0$ for some $x$, then $3P(x) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0$.
            Suppose $P(0) \neq 0$, then $P$ has no real root, so we're done.
            Suppose $P(0) = 0$. If $P$ takes both positive and negative
            values, then $P$ is surjective on $R$.
            Take infinitely many pairs $x,y$ such that $P(x)+P(y) = 0 \Rightarrow x+y =
            0 \Rightarrow P(x) + P(-x) = 0.$
            It follows that $P(x) + P(-x)\equiv 0$ for all real $x$. For fixed x, choose $z$ such
            that $P(x) + P(x) + P(z) = 0 \Rightarrow z = -2x \Rightarrow 2P(x) = P(2x)$, which gives $\deg(P) = 1$.<br />

            Suppose $P$ takes only positive values or only negative values. Then clearly $P$ has even multiplicity
            at 0, so $P(x) = x^{2n}Q(x)$ for some polynomial $Q(x)$ without real roots.
            Conversely, it is easy to
            check that the above polynomials work, since for $P(x) = ax$, $P(x) + P(y) + P(z) = a(x + y + z)$ and
            $a(x + y + z) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x + y + z=0$.
            For $P(x) = x^{2n}Q(x)$, clearly $P(x) + P(y) + P(z) \neq 0$ for $x, y, z$
            with not all of them equal to 0.

        <b>JOM 2013, Problem 4 (C3). </b>
        Let $n$ be a positive integer.
        A <i>pseudo-Gangnam Style</i> is a dance competition between players $A$ and $B$.
        At time $0$, both players face to the north.
        For every $k\ge 1$, at time $2k-1$, player $A$ can either choose to stay stationary, or turn $90^{\circ}$ clockwise,
        and player $B$ is forced to follow him;
        at time $2k$, player $B$ can either choose to stay stationary, or turn $90^{\circ}$ clockwise, and player $A$ is forced to follow him.
        <br />
        After time $n$, the music stops and the competition is over. If the final position of both players is north or east, $A$ wins. If the final position of both players is south or west, $B$ wins. Determine who has a winning strategy when:
        <br />
        (a) $n=2013^{2012}$;
        <br />
        (b) $n=2013^{2013}$.

    <button class="button" onclick="hideandshow(Q4,Q4button)" id="Q4button">Show Solution </button>
    <p id="Q4" style="border: 1px solid black; display: none;">
        (a) At time $1$, let $A$ choose to be stationary.
        For the subsequent steps (i.e. $k\ge 1$),
        if $B$ stays stationary at time $2k$ then $A$ moves $90^{\circ}$ at time $2k+1$.
        On the other hand, if $B$ turns $90^{\circ}$ at time $2k$ then $A$ stays stationary at time $2k+1.$
        So their positions form a cycle of period 8.
        In particular, at time $8k+1$ both players will come to original position, i.e. north.
        Since $2013^{2012}\equiv 1\pmod {8},$ their final position will be north and $A$ will win.
        <br />
        (b) For $k\ge 1$, if $A$ stays stationary at time $2k-1$ then $B$ moves $90^{\circ}$ at time $2k$.
        On the other hand, if $A$ turns $90^{\circ}$ at time $2k-1$ then $B$ stays stationary at time $2k.$
        Again, it is a cycle of period 8, and at time $8k+4$ both players are facing south.
        Since $2013^{2013}\equiv 5\pmod 8$, we know that at time $2013^{2013}-1$ both players are at south,
        and for the final step $A$ can only choose to stay facing south or turn $90^{\circ}$ clockwise to face west.
        So $B$ will definitely win.

                It is also clear that $3|2^p + 1$ (since $p$ is odd) and hence $p^p\equiv -1\pmod{3}$.
                So $p\equiv -1\pmod{3}\Rightarrow p^p\equiv -1\pmod{6}$.
                Also that $2^p\equiv -1\pmod{q}\Rightarrow 2^{2p}\equiv 1\pmod{q}$.
                Let $r$ to be the minimal positive integer such that $2^r\equiv 1\pmod{q}$.

                We will now show that $k\neq 1, 2$.
                We have $q|p^p+1\Rightarrow q|\left(\frac{q-1}{2k}\right)^p+1$
                $\Rightarrow q|\frac{(q-1)^p+(2k)^p}{(2k)^p}$
                $\Rightarrow q|-1+(2k)^p$, since $q$ is relatively prime to $2k$.
                If $k=1$, from $q|1+2^p$ follows $q|2$, which is impossible.
                If $k=2$, $q=4p+1$, and so $q=4p+1\equiv 4(2)+1\equiv 0\pmod{3}$,
                contradicting the fact that $q$ is prime.
                Hence $k\ge 3$ and $q\ge 6p+1 > 6p$, as desired.
