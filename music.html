    <h1>My Musical Background</h1>

        <h2>My Youtube Channel</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few songs that just could not live without, and I keep replaying them on Youtube and Spotify.
            What's better if I can honour the singers not only by listening to the music, but also perform it using my own style?
        </p>
        <p>
            Motivated by a friend, I set up my own Youtube channel with the piano playing of these pieces (most of them are by Olivia Ong at this moment).
            There are currently 5 of them, and happy listening!

            Graduation Song Composition
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
            My high school (Chung Ling High School Butterworth) has a tradition of having one unique graduation song for each graduating class.
            In 2013, six teams (including mine) submitted their proposals for the Class of 2013 Graduation Song.
            Among the four pieces shortlisted by the graduation committee, my piece was elected as the graduation song of the year with a majority of 25 votes
            (156 vs 131).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Motivation Behind
        </h3>
        <p>
            The melodic phrase "A-D-C#-D-A-D-D-E-F#" has been there in my head since Grade 7 (2009).
            "Wouldn't it be great if I could use it somewhere in a musical composition?" I thought.
            It's not until 2012 did I know that I am eligible to submit a graudation piece proposal,
            and I decided to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            A tougher question then confounded me: how, then, should I expand from that catchy phrase into something complete?
            Using my knowledge on rules of chord progression, I tried to concoct some melody by experimenting on my piano,
            hoping that they will form something melodious.
            Subsequently, I formed my team of lyricists, arranger, and singer with my completed piece,
            before making a preliminary recording with that.
            Finally, we made a studio-recorded version after winning the bidding contest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The recording is available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0jTXYR4i1A">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ryan-goi/studio-version?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=facebook">Soundcloud</a>. Enjoy listening!
